# Code Modifications

## Guidelines

All code modifications must following [PSR-0][], [PSR-1][], and [PSR-2][] as
outlined on the [PHP Framework Interop Group][php-fig].

An .editorconfig file is included to help setup your environment if your IDE supports
[EditorConfig][].

## Procedure

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually the master branch.
    * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git branch
      my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git
      checkout my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the
      `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
    * If your commit messages do not follow this format, please do a
      `git rebase -i master` to reword your commit messages.

    Subject Line Describing Your Changes
